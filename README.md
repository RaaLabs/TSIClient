The TSIClient is a Python SDK for Microsoft Azure time series insights. It provides methods to conveniently retrieve your data and is designed
for analysts, data scientists and developers working with time series data in Azure TSI.

> :warning: **Azure Time Series Insights will be deprecated on 31.3.2025**. Read the anncouncment from Microsoft here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/we-ll-retire-azure-time-series-insights-on-31-of-march-2025/.

The TSIClient will not be developed further by Raa Labs.

## Documentation
- Azure time series REST APIs: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/time-series-insights/>
- TSIClient: <https://raalabs-tsiclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Installation
We recommended to use a Python version >= 3.6. You can install the TSIClient from PyPi:
````bash
pip install TSIClient
````
Or if you want to get the latest code, directly fom GitHub:

````bash
pip install git+https://github.com/RaaLabs/TSIClient.git
````
## Quickstart
Instantiate the TSIClient to query your TSI environment. Log in to Azure using the Azure CLI:
````bash
az login --tenant <your-azure-tenant-id>
````

Now instantiate the client like this:

````python
from TSIClient import TSIClient as tsi

client = tsi.TSIClient(
    environment="<your-tsi-env-name>",
    applicationName="<your-app-name>"
)
````

You can check the docs at <https://raalabs-tsiclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html> for more information on authentication, and check
the old way of authentication (these will be removed in a future version).

You can query your timeseries data by timeseries id, timeseries name or timeseries description. The Microsoft TSI apis support aggregation, so you can specify a sampling freqency and aggregation methods. Refer to the documentation for detailed information.

````python
data = client.query.getDataById(
    timeseries=["timeseries_id1", "timeseries_id2"],
    timespan=["2019-12-12T15:35:11.68Z", "2019-12-12T17:02:05.958Z"],
    interval="PT5M",
    aggregateList=["avg", "max"],
    useWarmStore=False
)
````

This returns a pandas dataframe, which can be used for analysis.
